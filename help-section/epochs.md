# Epochs

## What is an Epoch?

An epoch is a distinctive period of time. In Pangaea every such epoch / period lasts for **10 minutes**, which usually constitutes around **75 blocks**.

## Pre-Staking Epochs

The pre-staking phase of Pangaea will last for **144 epochs / 24 hours**. After the pre-staking phase has finished the EPoS phase will start.

## EPoS Epochs

In EPoS a validator will go live within **1 epoch / 10 minutes** of issuing the [./hmy staking create-validator command](https://docs.harmony.one/pangaea/pangaea-validators/creating-a-validator).

When you decide to undelegate your tokens from a validator in Pangaea your tokens will be subjected to a cooldown period lasting **7 epochs / 70 minutes**.

This means that you **won't have access to your tokens or can transfer them for 70 minutes** after issuing the [./hmy staking undelegate command](https://docs.harmony.one/pangaea/pangaea-delegators/undelegation).
