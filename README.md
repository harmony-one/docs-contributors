# Introduction to Pangaea

![](.gitbook/assets/untitled_artwork-23.jpg)

**Pangaea is the name given to Earth’s first and best-known super continent, long before tectonic plates did all their shuffling around to create the planet we live on today. You could say that Pangaea is the ultimate example of a ‘borderless’ environment and evidence that we were all ONE in the beginning.**

We launched Pangaea in August 2019 as an experimental platform for thousands of users to interact with the Harmony network, test the limitations of our technology and have lots of fun while earning rewards.

If you’ve previously thought running a node was too technical or expensive, this is a great opportunity to give it a go. There is an amazing community on Pangaea to help you out every step of the way.

## The goals of Pangaea:

* Test Harmony’s upcoming core protocol milestones and updates such as staking smart contracts and resharding, on a network of all external nodes
* Set-up and onboard a vast number of nodes, ready to jump into the mainnet, through collective knowledge building and competitions
* Create an education oriented node community and reward community members who are willing to go the extra mile by taking leadership roles \(An awesome example here is [P-OPS](community.md)!\)

## Who can participate?

**EveryONE** — the more the merrier! To create a fully secure, permission-less, and sharded blockchain we need lots and lots of nodes.

If you want to get your hands dirty and play with the network, this is the way to go! Become a node, learn on the go, secure Pangaea and help out others.

In addition, you will win rewards for maintaining superior network performance during the game.

Technical requirements:

* Minimum of 2 cores, 2G RAM, 50 GB \(or more to be safe\) hard drive
* AWS t3.small or equivalent from other cloud provider
